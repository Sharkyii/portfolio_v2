Inshorts Clone
This is a lightweight clone of the Inshorts news website. It fetches short news snippets from a public News API and provides access to the full news articles by scraping the source websites. For users who prefer concise information, the website also uses an AI model (DistilBART) to summarize full articles into approximately 60 words.

How It Works
The app fetches short news articles using a public News API.

When the user clicks on "Read More", the full article is scraped from the original news website.

The full content is passed through the DistilBART model, which compresses it into a concise 60-word summary.
